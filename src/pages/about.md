Hello, my name is Bradly Ovitt. In this blog I discuss whatever engineering topics I'm learning about as well as all the cool things I'm working on.

I'm a self taught developer always on the lookout for new and exciting technologies. I mostly work with Scala but it might be worthwhile to provide a high-level overview of my main technologies:

- Scala(JS)
- ZIO
- Typescript
- Docker
- Play Framework
- Git
- Quine
- Redpanda
- gRPC
- QwikJS

I'm a huge advocate of learning by doing and I'm always looking for ways to challenge myself. I'm also a huge believer in the power of collaboration; I've seen amazing things happen when people work together, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn from others and share my knowledge.

Thanks for visiting my blog and I hope you enjoy it. Feel free to reach out with any comments or questions.

You can reach me here: [email](mailto:oobrad76@gmail.com).

Regards,

Bradly O.
