  My understanding of how to be a good engineer.
---

I used to have some form of imposter syndrome when it came to my ability to write software. I thought I was a risk of being exposed at any moment for not being up-to-snuff.

Then, I learned something. As programmers, most professionals people aren't that great. It's far too easy to fall into (years of experience) as your only credential, to stop educating yourself.

There's the other thing, most programmers are tought in schools, then they go into industry where they learn things as an intern, then junior, and eventually find themselves in senior roles where they're tasked with guiding lower level engineers.

This worked great in the past when industries moved slowly and experience meant more. Software is different. The landscape of writing software transforms significantly decade to decade. The past decade being a large emphasis on cloud technology and big data. I believe the next decade will emphasize intelligent systems and privacy-protecting technologies.

My point is that we need to keep learning. It's a process we need to do ourselves.

## Discipline:

At the of the day, being a good professional comes down to two things: wanting to do better and having the discipline to do better.

Take for example, exception handling in Java. Engineers weren't properly handling exceptions and it was developers thought it would be a good idea to make explicit what exceptions could be thrown in the function signature.

This is convenient for developers who want to properly handle errors. Nonetheless, a lot of errors go unhandled. There are reasons* for why this might not always be the case. Technical debt is something that should be considered but error handling can be not only a reliability concern but a security concern. 

Discipline is a path to writing better software. It means writing all that ugly boilerplate that makes your code more maintainable. It means taking application architecture seriously. It means using the right tools for the job, even if you're less familiar with them. It means proper test coverage. It means you should have an update policy, implement proper logging, do all the things you know you should probably be doing.

## The Consequences of no Discipline:

I suspect the vast majority of bugs, accessibility issues, and scalability issues come down to a lack of discipline. I've worked on teams with proper discipline and teams without it. I've seen no update policy, no tests, no code formatting, with a web framework that hadn't been updated in eight years. I certainly shows.

## Conclusion:

I'm not innocent. But I'm trying to do better.

I don't really know what to say here, so I'm gonna cut it here.
